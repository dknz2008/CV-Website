            <p>Worked in a team of five to analyse data and develop an Android App during <a href="https://datalandnz.github.io/">Dataland 2018</a>, a 48 hour Hackathon hosted at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wellington. <b>Third place winner overall</b>, as well as award for most <b>engaging presentation</b>. </p>
            <p>We tackled the problem provided by the NZTA; to design an app or tool with the goal of reducing the massive road toll in New Zealand.</p> 
            <p>We created a passive app that alerts drivers when a road is a potential risk. This worked by passively notifying the driver when a potentially risky road has been entered through sound, providing a Visual Risk map to show previous crashes close to you, and daily push notifications with driving tips and roll toll statistics.</p>
